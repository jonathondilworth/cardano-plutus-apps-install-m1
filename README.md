## PPP: Local Playground (MacOS M1, 2020)

*Hopefully, this helps solve any issues surrounding the use of MacOS M1 machines in time for those people to get involved in the course as soon as possible.*

*Note: I have [included a set of audioless videos](#videos) that demonstrate the process that is outlined in ยง3; as perhaps it's helpful to see, rather than to read.*

#### 1. Introduction

The purpose<sup><a href="fn1">1</a></sup> of this document is to assist plutus pioneer students encountering problems with [plutus-apps](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps) build procedures due to their preference to use MacOS as a primary operating system for the course. The overarching goal is to ensure that individuals who choose to use the M1 RISC chips from Apple are not penalised for their choice of hardware, situating all enrollees on an equal footing.

Having spent several hours pouring over this myself, I could not provide adequate assistance to any struggling peers - a couple of hours sleep later, I thought I ought to share at least the procedure that seemed to work for me.

#### 2. Reccomended Reading

* Renzwo provided the initial materials (specifically for M1 chips) that seemed to solve the build issues for me: [https://github.com/renzwo/cardano-plutus-apps-install-m1](https://github.com/renzwo/cardano-plutus-apps-install-m1) - I pretty much followed these instructions but also restarted my machine several times.
* There appears to be some variance in what works on different builds, XiTouch has produced a StackExchange post on some of the issues students encountered today: [https://cardano.stackexchange.com/questions/6287/lessons-learned-setting-up-plutus-playground-feedback-welcome](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/questions/6287/lessons-learned-setting-up-plutus-playground-feedback-welcome)

#### 3. The Procedure That Seemed To Work For Me

*EDIT: The initial documentation supplied by Renzwo has now been refined and should leave you with no problem with builds on M1 Macs. See: [https://github.com/renzwo/cardano-plutus-apps-install-m1](https://github.com/renzwo/cardano-plutus-apps-install-m1) - good work!*

<h3 id="videos">Recordings Of The Procedure</h3>

*These are really boring, but I'll leave these up in case you would rather watch the procedure:*
